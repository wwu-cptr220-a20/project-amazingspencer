                <p>
                    Around February 2020, rumors began to spread of a certain virus that could have
                    devastading consequences.
                    In March 2020, the coronavirus made its debut and had spread to the United States.
                    In an attempt to slow the spread, the country was shut down for months and preventative
                    measures
                    were
                    put
                    into place to slow the spread. Now after being shut down, the country is beginning to
                    reopen
                    and
                    businesses
                    are opening their doors with preventative measures still in place. These preventive
                    measures
                    include
                    wearing
                    face masks and social distancing. As Americans are getting back into the office and
                    perhaps
                    going to
                    the
                    grocery store
                    for the first time in months, Americans need to know the extent of this virus and what
                    the
                    stats
                    of
                    the
                    coronavirus are.

                    that you wash your hands often, avoid close contact, cover your mouth and nose with a
                    mask
                    when
                    around
                    others,
                    cover coughs and sneezes, clean and disinfect, and monitor your health daily to prevent
                    contracting
                    the
                    coronavirus.

                    provides
                    a
                    global map of
                    coronavirus hotspots and known locations. This site also
                    includes number of cases, number of deaths, and trends for the virus.

                    I believe that there is a real need for web applications for the coronavirus. People
                    want to
                    be
                    able
                    to
                    visit
                    a site that will inform and provide updated statistics on the extent of the coronavirus.
                    People
                    want
                    to
                    be
                    able to quickly and easily locate information related to the coronavirus. People will
                    also
                    want
                    to
                    see
                    how
                    their local governments are handling this virus and the web app could provide links to
                    local
                    government
                    sites.

                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    The coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China. According to <cite><a
                            href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus-history">WebMD</a></cite>, the coronavirus
                    began in
                    what is called
                    a "wet-market," where fresh meat and fish is sold daily and some animals sold are killed on the
                    spot.
                    "Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded
                    conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so
                    much it
                    can
                    start to infect and spread among people. Still, the Wuhan market didn't sell bats at the time of
                    the
                    outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which
                    are
                    sold
                    illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to
                    SARS-CoV-2
                    (a coronavirus).
                    As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct
                    contact
                    with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading
                    in
                    the
                    U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the
                    coronavirus."

                <p>
                    The coronavirus causes symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills,
                    cough,
                    fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or

                    , the virus is thought to be spread primarily from person-to-person. This means that to spread
                    from
                    person to person, individuals are likely within 6 feet of each other, close to someone who is
                    coughing
                    or sneezing. When a person coughs or sneezes, respiratory droplets are produced and can travel
                    through
                    the air and into the mouths or noses of nearby people. Recent studies also suggest that COVID-19
                    may
                    also be spread between people not showing symptoms.
